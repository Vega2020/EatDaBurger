## Overview:
EatDaBurger is a simple app that saves user entries (burgers) to an SQL server and allows the user to change their status (from eaten to not eaten). The project is intended to be a demonstration of handlebars templating to dynamically generate html pages and deployment of a functional web app.
        
## Installation:
EatDaBurger is meant to be accessed through Heroku by visiting its deployment page at https://radiant-river-09328.herokuapp.com.
        
## Usage:
Enter a burger in the text field. Choose whether the burger has been devoured or not. Click the add button and the burger will be added to the database! It will appear in the "devoured" or "not devoured" box. Users can move a burger from box to box by clicking the button next to its name and delete it by clicking the "delete" button next to it.
